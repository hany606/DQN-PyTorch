# Internship-Task
This repository is for solving a task for an internship

## TODO:

[] Implement DQN for value-based 

[] Implement REINFORCE for Policy Gradient

[] Implement simple Actor-Critic

[] Add setup.py file

[] Write good README.md with cool gifs

[] Perform different experiments

[] Add trained agents and videos directories

[] Add plots for different results with different algorithms

[] Use RLlib to show the difference between the implementd and the library's implementation and provide plots

[] Create a report with references and papers
